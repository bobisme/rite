## What This Is

Chat-oriented coordination CLI for AI coding agents. When multiple agents work on the same codebase — or across projects — they need a way to communicate, claim resources, and stay out of each other's way. rite provides that with zero infrastructure.

**Design principles:**
- **Zero infrastructure** — append-only JSONL on disk. No daemon, no server, no ports, no database.
- **Agent-first, human-friendly** — every command works headlessly with structured output (TOON/JSON/text). Humans get `rite ui`.
- **Claims for anything** — file globs, URIs (`bead://`, `db://`), ports — any string. Advisory locks, not enforced.
- **Append-only** — JSONL files are the source of truth. SQLite indexes are derived and rebuildable (`rite index rebuild`).
- **Convention over configuration** — sensible defaults, minimal setup. `rite send general "hello"` just works.

**Architecture:** Single binary (`rite`). Storage at `~/.local/share/rite/` — channels are `channels/<name>.jsonl`, claims in `claims.jsonl`, agent state in SQLite (derived). Telegram bridge (`rite telegram`) runs as a long-lived process. TUI (`rite ui`) is a separate mode.

**Scope boundaries — rite is a coordination primitive.** It is NOT a task runner, CI system, build tool, or general-purpose message queue. Push back on scope creep into: job scheduling, build automation, git operations beyond sync, file editing/patching, or process management.

## Pre-commit Checks

```bash
cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && just test
```

CI enforces these. Skipping them causes build failures and error emails.

## CLI Reference

All commands support `--agent <name>` (or `RITE_AGENT` env var), `--format toon|json|text`, `-q` (quiet), `-v` (verbose).

### Core

| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `send` | `rite send <target> <message> [-L label] [--attach file] [--reply-to id] [--no-hooks]` |
| `history` | `rite history [channel] [-n count] [-f] [--since/--before] [--from] [-L label] [--thread id] [--show-system]` |
| `inbox` | `rite inbox [-c channels] [--all] [--mentions] [-n count] [--mark-read] [--count-only]` |
| `mark-read` | `rite mark-read <channel>` |
| `search` | `rite search <query> [-c channel] [-n count] [--from]` |
| `wait` | `rite wait [-c channel] [--mentions] [--from agent] [-L label] [--reply-to id] [-t timeout]` |
| `watch` | `rite watch [channel]` — stream messages in real-time |
| `mentions follow` | `rite mentions follow --format json [--no-dms] [-L label]` — JSONL stream of every message mentioning you, across all channels, plus your DMs |
| `status` | `rite status` — overview of agents, channels, claims |

### Claims (advisory locks)

| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `claims stake` | `rite claims stake <patterns...> [-t ttl] [-m message]` |
| `claims check` | `rite claims check <path>` |
| `claims release` | `rite claims release [patterns...] [--all]` |
| `claims list` | `rite claims list [--all] [--mine] [-n limit]` |
| `claims refresh` | `rite claims refresh` — extend TTL |

#### Claim URI conventions

A claim pattern is any string. That is the design, and the cost is that two
tools which mean the same thing but spell it differently fail to interlock —
silently, because an advisory lock nobody else checks always succeeds.

Use these spellings. Do not invent a synonym for one of them.

| Pattern | Meaning | Staked by |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `spawn://<hook-id>/<channel>` | **Reserved for rite.** One live spawn per hook and channel. | rite only — never stake by hand |
| `message://<project>/<message-id>` | This message is being processed; a second agent must skip it | the responder handling it |
| `agent://<name>` | This agent is occupied — hook conditions and slot admission | hooks, agent loops |
| `bone://<project>/<id>` | Working this bone | the worker |
| `workspace://<project>/<ws>` | Working in this workspace | the worker |

`spawn://` is reserved because a lease in that scheme is the **only** claim
rite will step over when its holder is provably gone (presence lapsed beyond
`PRESENCE_TTL_SECS`). Confining that rule to a scheme rite writes itself is
what guarantees it can never apply to `src/**`, `bone://…`, or anything a
person staked.

`message://` and `spawn://` answer different questions and you usually want
both. The spawn lease is admission control — it stops a second agent from
*starting*. The message claim is idempotency — it stops two agents that both
started from doing the same work twice. Supersession means those two agents
genuinely can overlap, so the message claim is what makes the overlap safe.

### Management

| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `agents` | `rite agents [--active]` |
| `channels` | `rite channels list\|close\|reopen\|delete\|rename` |
| `hooks` | `rite hooks add [--name --owner]\|list [--owner]\|set\|remove\|test\|drain` |
| `subscriptions` | `rite subscriptions add\|remove\|list` |
| `statuses` | `rite statuses set\|clear\|list` |
| `messages` | `rite messages get <id>` |

### Sync & Infra

| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `sync` | `rite sync init\|push\|pull\|status\|log\|check` |
| `index` | `rite index rebuild\|status` |
| `telegram` | `rite telegram` — run Telegram bridge |
| `ui` | `rite ui [-c channel]` — terminal UI |
| `init` | `rite init` — create data directory |
| `doctor` | `rite doctor` — check environment health |
| `generate-name` | `rite generate-name` — random kebab-case name |
| `whoami` | `rite whoami` |

### Attachments

```bash
rite send general "see attached" --attach ./screenshot.png
rite send general "link" --attach https://example.com/file.tar.gz
rite send general "named" --attach "label:./path/to/file"
```

Files are stored in a content-addressed cache (SHA256). The Telegram bridge relays attachments bidirectionally.

### Threads

Several agents in one channel produce an interleaved transcript. Anchor a
message to the one it answers so a reader can tell what answers what.

```bash
# The id of the message you just sent, for machines
rite send rite "Review requested: rv-12 @rite-security" --format json
# → {"id":"01K2...","channel":"rite", ...}

# Answer a specific message
rite send rite "Reviewing rv-12 now" --reply-to 01K2...

# Inside a hook, the triggering message is already in the environment
rite send "$RITE_CHANNEL" "on it" --reply-to "$RITE_MESSAGE_ID"

# Read the whole conversation, from any message in it
rite history --thread 01K2...
```

Rules:

- No `--reply-to` means top-level. That is the default and every message
  written before threading existed.
- `--reply-to` accepts an id that has not synced here yet. You get a warning,
  not an error.
- `--thread` finds the channel from the id, so you do not have to name one.
- A thread whose parent is missing or deleted comes back as a fragment, marked
  `complete: false` with `missing_parent` set. It is never presented as a whole
  conversation.
- An anchor this build cannot read is dropped so the message survives, and the
  drop is reported: once on stderr per file, and counted by `rite doctor` as
  `damaged_field_count`. A reply that quietly became top-level is how an
  acknowledgment stops correlating, so it is never silent.

### Acknowledgment

Do not post a request and guess whether it landed. Block on the answer.

```bash
id=$(rite send rite "Review requested: rv-12 @rite-security" --format json | jq -r .id)
rite wait --reply-to "$id" -t 300 --format json
```

Exit codes:

| exit | meaning | what to do |
|------|---------|------------|
| 0 | answered | read `message` from the JSON |
| 1 | nobody answered inside `-t` | escalate. Do not send the request again |
| 2 | the id is not a ULID, or this store never saw it | fix the id |

`--reply-to` narrows the other flags. `--mentions` and `-c` are places, so they
combine with OR. `--reply-to` is one question, and `--from`, `-c`, and `-L`
only remove candidate answers from it. With no `-c`, every channel is watched,
so a reply in a DM counts. Your own reply does not acknowledge you. A reply
that landed before the wait started is still reported, so there is no race
between `rite send` and `rite wait`. Use `--allow-missing-parent` only when the
parent is still syncing in from another machine.

### Changing a Hook

Change a hook in place. Do not remove and re-add it.

```bash
rite hooks set hk-abc --cwd /home/me/src/project   # repoint a moved project
rite hooks set hk-abc --lease --lease-ttl 1800     # turn the spawn lease on
rite hooks set hk-abc --no-lease                   # back to cooldown
rite hooks set hk-abc -- vessel spawn ... -- edict run responder
```

Every field you do not name keeps its value, including fields this build does
not understand.

The hook ID is the spawn-lease key (`spawn://<id>/<channel>`). Remove-and-add
issues a new ID, so a spawn that is still running holds a lease nobody checks
any more and the replacement spawns a second agent beside it. It also clears
`last_fired`, which hands a cooldown hook an immediate free firing, and it
drops any field the person retyping the command did not know about.

### Managing Hooks From Another Tool

A tool that registers hooks (edict, a setup script) gives each one a stable
`--name` and re-runs the same `hooks add` to converge it.

```bash
rite hooks add --name edict:rite:responder --owner edict \
  --channel rite --mention rite-dev --cwd /home/me/src/rite \
  -- vessel spawn --name rite-responder --cwd /home/me/src/rite -- edict run responder

rite hooks list --owner edict     # every hook that tool manages
```

A name is unique per channel. Adding again with the same name updates that
hook and keeps its ID. **Whatever the converge does not name keeps its current
value** — including the lease. So a manager that has never heard of `--lease`
cannot strip one, which is how a leased hook previously reverted to cooldown
without a word.

Turning a lease off is therefore deliberate: `rite hooks set <id> --no-lease`.
`--priority` carries a default of 0, so a converge treats 0 as "unspecified";
use `hooks set --priority 0` to actually set it back to zero.

Adopt the hooks you already have rather than recreating them:

```bash
rite hooks set hk-abc --name edict:rite:responder --owner edict
```

### Stranded Triggers

A hook with `--lease` batches triggers that arrive while a spawn is live and
hands them to the next spawn. Nothing schedules that next spawn, so if the
channel goes quiet the batch waits.

rite delivers it by riding traffic that already exists: every command that
evaluates hooks re-checks pending queues in **every** channel, so a `rite send`
in `#maw` delivers a trigger stranded in `#console`. There is no daemon and no
timer.

```bash
rite hooks drain --dry-run                    # what is stranded, changing nothing
rite hooks drain                              # deliver it now, without waiting for traffic
rite hooks drain --discard --hook-id hk-abc   # throw the backlog away instead
```

You do not normally run either. Use `--dry-run` to explain a responder that
seems not to have woken up, and the bare command when nothing else is talking
to rite — a quiet machine is the one case the sweep cannot ride.

What a swept spawn sees is identical to a message-driven one: `RITE_CHANNEL` is
the channel the trigger came from (not whichever channel was busy),
`RITE_MESSAGE_ID` is the newest queued trigger, and `RITE_BATCH_MESSAGE_IDS` is
chronological with that anchor last.

Two things bound it. The spawn lease is taken exactly as a message would take
it, so a sweep can no more double-spawn than a message can; and a hook is swept
at most once a minute, because a spawn that fails leaves its batch queued and
would otherwise be retried by every rite command on the machine.

`--discard` is for a backlog no longer worth acting on. A responder that was
down while its channel stayed busy comes back to as many as 500 queued
triggers and works through them 50 per spawn — ten spawns replaying a day-old
conversation. It needs `--hook-id` or `--all`, because a discarded queue does
not come back. The messages do: they are durable in their channel, so a
discard loses the wake-up and never the content.

`hooks remove` retires whatever is queued for that hook — nothing could ever
deliver it, since every delivery path matches on the hook id. Prefer
`hooks set`, which does not reach that path at all.

### System Messages

`rite history` and `rite ui` hide machine bookkeeping — hook firings, agent
registrations, claim expiries. On a busy channel that is a fifth to nearly half
of every read, and it is never what a reader came for.

```bash
rite history rite                 # readable messages only
rite history rite --show-system   # include hook firings
```

Nothing is hidden silently. Text output ends with `N system messages hidden
(--show-system)`, and JSON carries `hidden_system` plus an `advice` entry. A
hook that fires and fails to spawn records `executed: false`, exactly like one
skipped for cooldown, so that line is often the only evidence it ran at all.

`--from system` and `--thread` include system messages without the flag, and
`-n` counts readable messages. Claim records are not treated as system
messages: they are the entire content of `#claims`.

In `rite ui`, ctrl+h toggles them back on.

### Message Flags

Inline flags in message body suppress hook execution:
- `!nohooks` — suppress all hooks
- `!nochanhooks` — suppress channel hooks only
- `!noathooks` — suppress @-mention hooks only

Example: `rite send general "deploy done !nohooks"`

Alternatively, use `--no-hooks` on the CLI.

## Agent Communication

### Identity

```bash
# Recommended: --agent flag (works in sandboxed environments)
rite --agent my-agent send general "hello"

# Alternative: env var (doesn't persist across sandboxed commands)
export RITE_AGENT=$(rite generate-name)
```

### Quick Start

```bash
rite status                                    # What's happening?
rite send general "Starting work on X"         # Announce
rite send @other-agent "Question about Y"      # DM
rite claims stake "src/api/**" -m "Working on API"  # Claim files
rite claims check src/api/routes.rs            # Check before editing
rite claims release --all                      # Release when done
rite wait -c @other-agent -t 60               # Wait for reply
```

### Channel Conventions

- `#general` — cross-project coordination
- `#project-name` — project-specific (e.g., `#rite`)
- `@agent-name` — direct messages

Names: lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens.

### Message Style

Keep messages concise and actionable:
- "Starting work on bd-xyz: Add foo feature"
- "Blocked: need database credentials to proceed"
- "Done: implemented bar, tests passing"

---

## Development Notes

- Storage: `~/.local/share/rite/` (override with `RITE_DATA_DIR`)
- Identity: `RITE_AGENT` env var or `--agent` flag
- Claims stored with absolute paths, displayed relative when in same directory tree
- Git sync disables GPG signing in data repos automatically
- JSONL is append-only; indexes derived via `rite index rebuild`

### Output Formats

Commands default to TOON (token-efficient for agents). Use `--format json` for structured parsing or `--format text` for human reading. See [.agents/cli-output.md](.agents/cli-output.md) for detailed format guidance.

## Tools

### Beads (Issue Tracking)

Uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust). Issues in `.beads/`, tracked in git. `br` never runs git commands — after `br sync --flush-only`, manually commit and push.

```bash
br ready                          # Actionable work
br show <id>                      # Full details
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br close <id>
```

### bv (Beads Viewer)

Fast TUI for `.beads/issues.jsonl` with precomputed dependency metrics. For agents, use the robot flags instead of parsing JSONL:

- `bv --robot-help` — all AI-facing commands
- `bv --robot-plan` — execution plan with parallel tracks
- `bv --robot-priority` — priority recommendations
- `bv --robot-insights` — graph metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles)

## Edict Workflow

### How to Make Changes

1. **Create a bone** to track your work: `bn create --title "..." --description "..."`
2. **Create a workspace** for your changes: `maw ws create <bone-id> --from main --description "<bone-title>"` — use the bone ID as workspace name; this gives you `.maw/workspaces/<bone-id>/`
3. **Edit files in your workspace** (`.maw/workspaces/<name>/`), never in the trunk at the repo root
4. **Merge when done**: `maw ws merge <name> --into default --destroy --message "feat: <bone-title>"` (use conventional commit prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.; swap `default` for a change id when merging back into a tracked change)
5. **Close the bone**: `bn done <id>`

Do not create git branches manually — `maw ws create` handles branching for you. See [worker-loop.md](.agents/edict/worker-loop.md) for the full triage → start → work → finish cycle.

**All tools have `--help`** with usage examples. When unsure, run `<tool> --help` or `<tool> <command> --help`.

### Conflicts Are Data, Not Errors

`maw ws sync` rebases committed-ahead workspaces onto the latest epoch by default. On conflict it does not abort — it commits labeled conflict markers and leaves the workspace `lifecycle:conflicted` (visible in `maw ws list`). Treat a conflicted workspace as a normal state, not a failure.

- `maw ws resolve <ws> --list` shows conflicts; `--keep epoch|<ws>|both|union` (or `--keep PATH=NAME`) resolves them.
- `maw ws merge` auto-syncs stale sources and accepts `--resolve cf-id=<ws>` / `--resolve-all=<ws>` to resolve inline.
- `maw ws conflicts <ws>` inspects conflict details.
- The one hard gate: merge refuses a source whose HEAD still has unresolved conflict markers (bypass with `--force` only for legitimate marker-like content).

### Directory Structure

This project uses the **root** layout. The project root is the trunk working copy — source files, `.bones/`, config, and `AGENTS.md` live there. Extra agent workspaces live under `.maw/workspaces/`.

```
project-root/              ← trunk working copy (AGENTS.md, .bones/, src/, etc.)
├── src/, AGENTS.md, …     ← your project files, edited here directly
├── .maw/
│   ├── workspaces/
│   │   ├── bn-1abc/       ← agent workspace (named after bone ID)
│   │   └── bn-2def/       ← another agent workspace
│   └── manifold/          ← maw metadata/artifacts
└── .git/                  ← git data
```

**Key rules:**
- The project root is the trunk — bones, config, and project files live here, and you edit them directly
- **Never merge or destroy the `default` workspace.** `default` names the trunk (the repo root); other workspaces merge INTO it, not the other way around.
- Agent workspaces (`.maw/workspaces/<name>/`) are isolated Git worktrees managed by maw
- Use `maw exec <ws> -- <command>` to run commands in a non-default workspace context
- Run `bn ...` directly at the repo root for bones commands (no `maw exec` prefix needed — they always target the trunk)
- Use `maw exec <ws> -- seal ...` for review commands (always in the review's workspace)

### Bones Quick Reference

| Operation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Triage (scores) | `bn triage` |
| Next bone | `bn next` |
| Next N bones | `bn next N` (e.g., `bn next 4` for dispatch) |
| Show bone | `bn show <id>` |
| Create | `bn create --title "..." --description "..."` |
| Start work | `bn do <id>` |
| Add comment | `bn bone comment add <id> "message"` |
| Close | `bn done <id>` |
| Add dependency | `bn triage dep add <blocker> --blocks <blocked>` |
| Search | `bn search <query>` |

Identity resolved from `$AGENT` env. No flags needed in agent loops.

### Workspace Quick Reference

| Operation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Create workspace | `maw ws create <bone-id> --from main --description "<title>"` |
| List workspaces | `maw ws list` |
| Check merge readiness | `maw ws merge <name> --into default --check` |
| Merge to main | `maw ws merge <name> --into default --destroy --message "feat: <bone-title>"` |
| Destroy (no merge) | `maw ws destroy <name>` |
| Run command in workspace | `maw exec <name> -- <command>` |
| Diff workspace vs epoch | `maw ws diff <name>` |
| Check workspace overlap | `maw ws overlap <name1> <name2>` |
| View workspace history | `maw ws history <name>` |
| Sync stale workspace | `maw ws sync <name>` |
| Inspect merge conflicts | `maw ws conflicts <name>` |
| Undo local workspace changes | `maw ws undo <name>` |
| List recovery snapshots | `maw ws recover` |
| Recover destroyed workspace | `maw ws recover <name> --to <new-name>` |
| Search recovery snapshots | `maw ws recover --search <pattern>` |
| Show file from snapshot | `maw ws recover <name> --show <path>` |

**Inspecting a workspace:**
```bash
maw exec <name> -- git status             # what changed (unstaged)
maw exec <name> -- git log --oneline -5   # recent commits
maw ws diff <name>                        # diff vs epoch (maw-native)
```

**Lead agent merge workflow** — after a worker finishes a bone:
1. `maw ws list` — look for `active (+N to merge)` entries
2. `maw ws merge <name> --into default --check` — verify no conflicts
3. `maw ws merge <name> --into default --destroy --message "feat: <bone-title>"` — merge and clean up (use conventional commit prefix)

**Workspace safety:**
- Never merge or destroy `default`.
- Always `maw ws merge <name> --into default --check` before `--destroy`.
- Commit workspace changes with `maw exec <name> -- git add -A && maw exec <name> -- git commit -m "..."`.
- **No work is ever lost in maw.** Recovery snapshots are created automatically on every destroy. If a workspace was destroyed and you suspect code is missing, ALWAYS run `maw ws recover` before concluding work was lost. Never reopen a bone or start over without checking recovery first.

### Protocol Quick Reference

Use these commands at protocol transitions to check state and get exact guidance. Each command outputs instructions for the next steps.

| Step | Command | Who | Purpose |
|------|---------|-----|---------|
| Resume | `edict protocol resume --agent $AGENT` | Worker | Detect in-progress work from previous session |
| Start | `edict protocol start <bone-id> --agent $AGENT` | Worker | Verify bone is ready, get start commands |
| Review | `edict protocol review <bone-id> --agent $AGENT` | Worker | Verify work is complete, get review commands |
| Finish | `edict protocol finish <bone-id> --agent $AGENT` | Worker | Verify review approved, get close/cleanup commands |
| Merge | `edict protocol merge <workspace> --agent $AGENT` | Lead | Check preconditions, detect conflicts, get merge steps |
| Cleanup | `edict protocol cleanup --agent $AGENT` | Worker | Check for held resources to release |

All commands support JSON output with `--format json` for parsing. If a command is unavailable or fails (exit code 1), fall back to manual steps documented in [start](.agents/edict/start.md), [review-request](.agents/edict/review-request.md), and [finish](.agents/edict/finish.md).

### Bones Conventions

- Create a bone before starting work. Update state: `open` → `doing` → `done`.
- Post progress comments during work for crash recovery.
- **Run checks before committing**: `just check` (or your project's build/test command). Fix any failures before proceeding.
- After finishing a bone, follow [finish.md](.agents/edict/finish.md). **Workers: do NOT push** — the lead handles merges and pushes.

### Release Instructions

- Bump the version of all crates
- Regenerate the Cargo.lock
- Add notes to CHANGELOG.md
- If the README.md references the version, update it.
- Commit
- Tag and push: `maw release vX.Y.Z`
- use `gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes "..."`
- Install locally: `maw exec default -- just install`

### Identity

Your agent name is set by the hook or script that launched you. Use `$AGENT` in commands.
For manual sessions, use `<project>-dev` (e.g., `myapp-dev`).

### Claims

When working on a bone, stake claims to prevent conflicts:

```bash
rite claims stake --agent $AGENT "bone://<project>/<id>" -m "<id>"
rite claims stake --agent $AGENT "workspace://<project>/<ws>" -m "<id>"
rite claims release --agent $AGENT --all  # when done
```

### Reviews

`--reviewers` assigns the approval-gate identity in Seal. It does not spawn a
reviewer. For security review, create a Rite request anchor and explicitly
launch the one-review Daybreak session in
[security-review.md](.agents/edict/security-review.md). Never use an
`@<project>-security` mention: the ambient hook is retired.

```bash
maw exec $WS -- seal reviews request <review-id> --reviewers $PROJECT-security --agent $AGENT
req=$(rite send --agent $AGENT $PROJECT "Dedicated security re-review requested: <review-id> in $WS" -L review-response --format json | jq -r .id)
bn bone comment add <bone-id> "Review anchor: $req for <review-id>"
# Set review_id=<review-id>, ws=$WS, request_anchor=$req, kind=review-response.
# Follow .agents/edict/security-review.md's Launch contract exactly.
```

- Agentbus completion is not approval. Confirm the verdict with
  `maw exec $WS -- seal review <review-id> --format json` before proceeding.
- Agentbus unresolved, blocked, unavailable, or timeout: post one anchored
  `task-blocked` message, release the review claim, and stop. Do not retry by
  mention or scan another review.

**Dedicated reviewers** reply to the supplied request anchor with
`--reply-to "$request_anchor"` and `-L review-done`. A top-level verdict is not
an anchored result.

#### What a review covers

`seal reviews create` finds the fork point of your branch or workspace, so the review
covers every commit of the feature. It prints the range and commit count — check it.
`--base <rev>` sets the range explicitly; `--base <target>~1` reviews the tip commit only.
The base is persisted, so later commits extend the range instead of shifting it.

#### Do not commit after the LGTM

An approval records the commit it covered. Commit anything afterwards and
`seal reviews mark-merged` exits 1: "the approval does not cover the current code".

- **Fix**: get a fresh LGTM. A repeat vote moves the approval onto the new commit.
  Reviewers — that repeat LGTM is what unblocks the merge, so never leave a re-review
  unvoted.
- `--allow-stale-approval` merges past the check. Use it only when the new commits are
  provably outside what was reviewed, and say why in a bone comment.
- Check first: `maw exec $WS -- seal diff <review-id> --format json` reports
  `approval_stale`, `approved_commit` and `uncovered_commits`.

### Bus Communication

Agents communicate via rite channels. You don't need to be expert on everything — ask the right project.

| Operation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Send message | `rite send --agent $AGENT <channel> "message" [-L label]` |
| Reply to a message | `rite send --agent $AGENT <channel> "message" --reply-to <msg-id>` |
| Capture the id you sent | `rite send ... --format json \| jq -r .id` |
| Check inbox | `rite inbox --agent $AGENT --channels <ch> [--mark-read]` |
| Wait for an answer | `rite wait --agent $AGENT --reply-to <msg-id> -t 300 --format json` |
| Wait for any mention | `rite wait --mentions --from <agent> -t 120` |
| Read a thread | `rite history --thread <msg-id>` |
| Browse history | `rite history <channel> -n 20` |
| Search messages | `rite search "query" -c <channel>` |

**Project experts**: Each `<project>-dev` is the expert on their project. When stuck on a companion tool (rite, maw, seal, vessel, bn), post a question to its project channel instead of guessing.

#### Threads

Every message you send answers something or starts something. Anchor the answers.

- `--reply-to <id>` anchors a message under a parent. No `--reply-to` means top-level.
- When a hook spawned you, the message that woke you is `$RITE_MESSAGE_ID`. Answer it:
  `rite send --agent $AGENT "$RITE_CHANNEL" "on it" --reply-to "$RITE_MESSAGE_ID"`.
  A lease batch instead sets `$RITE_BATCH_MESSAGE_IDS`, in chronological order. The
  anchor is the LAST id in that list, not the first.
- An anchor that is not in the store yet gives a warning, not an error. The reply links
  up when the parent syncs in.
- `rite history --thread <id>` reads the whole thread from any message in it, and finds
  the channel itself. A thread reported `complete:false` is a fragment — say so, do not
  present it as the whole conversation.
- Your prompt carries the anchor for the current turn. Use that one. Never reuse the
  anchor from an earlier turn.

#### Ask and Wait

Never post a question and hope. Anchor it, then block on the answer:

```bash
id=$(rite send --agent $AGENT <channel> "<question> @<target>" -L feedback --format json | jq -r .id)
rite wait --agent $AGENT --reply-to "$id" -t 300 --format json
```

| Exit | Meaning | What to do |
|------|---------|------------|
| 0 | Answered | Read `.message.body` from the JSON and act on it |
| 1 | Nobody answered in time | Escalate: post one `-L task-blocked` naming the anchor, record it on the bone, move on. **Never re-send the request.** |
| 2 | Not a ULID, or this store never saw it | Fix the id (`rite history <channel> --from $AGENT -n 1 --format json` returns `last_id`). Do not re-send. Add `--allow-missing-parent` only when the parent is still syncing in from another machine. |

`--reply-to` narrows the wait, it never widens it. `--from`, `-c` and `-L` only subtract
candidate answers. With no `-c` every channel counts, so a reply in a DM satisfies the
wait. A reply that arrived before the wait started still counts. Your own reply never
satisfies your own wait.

### Cross-Project Communication

**Don't suffer in silence.** If a tool confuses you or behaves unexpectedly, post to its project channel.

1. Find the project: `rite history projects -n 50` (the #projects channel has project registry entries)
2. Ask and wait — capture the id, then block on the answer:
   ```bash
   id=$(rite send --agent $AGENT <project> "<question> @<project>-dev" -L feedback --format json | jq -r .id)
   rite wait --agent $AGENT --reply-to "$id" -t 300 --format json
   ```
3. For bugs, create bones in their repo first
4. **On exit 1 (no answer), create a local tracking bone** and move on. Record the anchor
   so the next check reads the thread instead of asking again:
   ```bash
   bn create --title "[tracking] <summary>" --tag tracking --kind task \
     --description "Asked #<project>: <question>. Anchor: <id>. Check: rite history --thread <id>"
   ```

See [cross-channel.md](.agents/edict/cross-channel.md) for the full workflow.

### Communication

Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English for prose. Strict compliance is not the goal. Aim for terse, unambiguous language.

Do not apply STE to code, identifiers, commands, marketing copy, essays, or voice-driven writing.

#### Language

- Limit sentences to 20 words.
- Replace semicolons and contractions.
- Use active voice when the actor is known.
- Use plain verbs. Avoid nominalization, phrasal verbs, and "-ing" main verbs.
- Use one consistent name for each thing.

#### rite messages

Keep a channel message to one or two lines. Lead with the subject of the label. The label and the bone ID already carry the context, so do not add status blocks, numbered steps, or closing actions.

- `[task-claim] Working on <bone-id>: <title>`
- `[review-request] Dedicated security review requested: <review-id> for <bone-id>`
- `[task-blocked] Blocked on <thing>: <what unblocks it>`

Anchor an answer with `--reply-to` instead of quoting the message you answer. The anchor
carries the context.

#### Replies to a human

1. Start with a concrete action. Put commands, paths, or snippets first.
2. Number multistep tasks. Give each step one bounded action.
3. Limit lists to five items. Split longer lists by priority.
4. State the current step, what is complete, what remains, and what it waits on.
5. End with the next action, or state what you wait on.

Finish the current issue before you present another. State errors as evidence, cause, and fix.

Do not use preambles, recaps, pleasantries, tangents, emotional error language, or empty hedges.

Never state a time estimate you cannot support. You do not know how long a build, a test run, or another agent takes. Name what you wait on instead.

#### Exceptions

- Explain fully when the user asks for an explanation or a walkthrough.
- Confirm before destructive actions.
- After three failed fixes, state the uncertain assumption and ask one diagnostic question.
- Ask one short question when real ambiguity makes a guess risky.

Before you send, remove announcements, repeated summaries, sidebars, and empty closing questions.

The first line must give the action. The last line must give the result or the next action.

### Session Search (optional)

Use `cass search "error or problem"` to find how similar issues were solved in past sessions.
