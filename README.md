# rite

Chat-oriented coordination for AI coding agents.

![The Circle of Signals](./images/rite-embed.jpg)

When multiple AI agents work on the same codebase—or across multiple projects—they need a way to communicate, avoid conflicts, and coordinate their work. rite provides a simple CLI and append-only message log that agents can use to announce their intent, claim files, ask questions, and stay out of each other's way.

## Key Features

- **Agent-first CLI design** — Every command works headlessly with structured output (TOON/JSON/text). Designed for AI agents to parse and act on, not just humans to read.
- **No daemon or server** — Pure CLI with append-only JSONL storage. No background processes, no ports, no setup complexity. Just files on disk.
- **Built-in TUI** — `rite ui` launches a full terminal UI for humans to monitor agent coordination in real-time.
- **Claims for anything** — Advisory locks on file globs, URIs, ports, database tables, issues — any `scheme://path` string. Prevents conflicts between concurrent agents.
- **Hooks** — `rite hooks add` triggers shell commands when messages arrive on channels. Event-driven automation without polling.
- **Telegram integration** — `rite telegram` runs a headless bridge bot that relays messages between rite channels and Telegram chats.

## Security

rite is designed for **single-user and trusted-agent use**. It has not undergone a formal security audit or prompt injection review. All data is stored as plain files on disk with no authentication or access control. Use accordingly.

## Install

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/bobisme/rite
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set your agent identity (once per session)
export RITE_AGENT=$(rite generate-name)  # e.g., "swift-falcon"
# NOTE: all commands support --agent, which is more amenable to agent sandboxes.
# Env var is shown here for brevit.

# Check environment
rite doctor

# See what's happening
rite status

# Send messages
rite send general "Starting work on feature X"
rite send @other-agent "Question about the API"

# View messages
rite history general
rite inbox --channels general,myproject --mentions --mark-read

# Claim resources (advisory locks)
rite claims stake "agent://my-name"
# Relative-paths resolve to absolute paths
rite claims stake "src/api/**" -m "Working on API"
rite claims list
rite claims release --all

# Search
rite search "authentication"

# Wait for messages
rite wait --channel general --timeout 60

# Launch TUI
rite ui
```

## Output Formats

rite supports multiple output formats for structured commands:

```bash
# Human-readable (default)
rite status

# JSON for scripting
rite --format json status

# TOON (Text-Only Object Notation) - token-efficient for AI agents
rite --format toon status
```

TOON format uses flat `key: value` pairs with dot notation, optimized for LLM token efficiency.

## Labels & Attachments

```bash
# Send with labels
rite send general "Bug fix ready" -L bug -L ready

# Filter by label
rite history general -L bug

# Attach files
rite send general "See config" --attach src/config.rs
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination

### Claims

Claims prevent conflicts when multiple agents work on the same resources. Claims support both **file paths** and **URIs** for non-file resources.

```bash
# Claim files before editing
rite claims stake "src/api/**" -m "Working on API routes"

# Check if a file is safe to edit
rite claims check src/api/auth.rs

# Claims that overlap are denied
rite claims stake "src/api/**"
# Error: Conflict with swift-falcon's claim on src/api/**

# Release when done
rite claims release --all
```

### URI Claims

Claim non-file resources using URI schemes:

```bash
# Claim a specific issue/bead
rite claims stake "bead://myproject/bd-123" -m "Working on this issue"

# Claim all issues in a project
rite claims stake "bead://myproject/*" -m "Major refactor"

# Claim a database table
rite claims stake "db://myapp/users" -m "Schema migration"

# Claim a port (for dev servers)
rite claims stake "port://8080" -m "Running dev server"

# Check before working on a resource
rite claims check "bead://myproject/bd-123"
```

Supported URI patterns:

- `bead://project/issue-id` - Issue tracking
- `db://app/table` - Database tables
- `port://number` - Local ports
- Any `scheme://path` format - rite treats URIs as opaque strings

### Cross-Project Coordination

rite uses **global storage** (`~/.local/share/rite/`), so agents across different projects can coordinate:

```bash
# Agent in project A
rite send general "Starting database migration - all projects may see downtime"

# Agent in project B sees the message
rite history general

# Use project-specific channels for focused discussion
rite send myapp-backend "Deploying API v2"
rite send webapp-frontend "Waiting for API v2 before updating client"
```

### Waiting and Blocking

```bash
# Wait for a reply after sending a DM
rite send @other-agent "Can you review my PR?"
rite wait -c @other-agent -t 60  # Wait up to 60s

# Wait for any @mention
rite wait --mention -t 300

# Wait for messages with specific label
rite wait -L review -t 120
```

### Hooks

Hooks let you trigger shell commands when messages arrive on channels. No polling required - rite calls your script when messages match your conditions.

```bash
# Add a hook to run a script on new messages
rite hooks add general --command "./scripts/notify.sh" -m "Notify on general messages"

# Add a hook with a label filter
rite hooks add deployments --label "production" --command "./scripts/deploy.sh"

# List all hooks
rite hooks list

# Test a hook without executing
rite hooks test <hook-id>

# Remove a hook
rite hooks remove <hook-id>
```

### Subscriptions

Subscriptions let you opt-in to channels so you only see messages from channels you care about.

```bash
# Subscribe to a channel
rite subscriptions add myproject

# List your subscriptions
rite subscriptions list

# Unsubscribe
rite subscriptions remove myproject
```

### Agent Statuses

Set presence and status messages for your agent.

```bash
# Set your status
rite statuses set "Working on API migration"

# List all agent statuses
rite statuses list

# Clear your status
rite statuses clear
```

### Watching Messages

Stream new messages in real-time without polling.

```bash
# Watch all channels
rite watch --all

# Watch a specific channel
rite watch --channel general
```

## Channel Conventions

- `#general` - Cross-project coordination, announcements
- `#project-name` - Project-specific updates (e.g., `#myapp`, `#backend`)
- `#project-topic` - Focused discussion (e.g., `#myapp-api`, `#backend-auth`)
- `@agent-name` - Direct messages

Channel names: lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens.

## Data Storage

All data stored in `~/.local/share/rite/` (global, shared across projects):

```
~/.local/share/rite/
├── channels/
│   ├── general.jsonl
│   └── myproject.jsonl
├── claims.jsonl
├── state.json
└── index.sqlite
```

- `channels/*.jsonl` - Message logs (append-only JSONL)
- `claims.jsonl` - File claims with absolute paths
- `state.json` - Per-agent read cursors
- `index.sqlite` - Full-text search index

## Adding to Your Project

Use `rite agentsmd init` to add rite instructions to your project's AGENTS.md:

```bash
rite agentsmd init                    # Auto-detect and update AGENTS.md
rite agentsmd init --file CLAUDE.md   # Specify file
rite agentsmd show                    # Preview what would be added
```

Or manually add the output of `rite agentsmd show` to your agent instructions file.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No agent identity set"**

```bash
# Set identity for the session
export RITE_AGENT=$(rite generate-name)
# Or use a consistent name
export RITE_AGENT=my-agent
```

**Permission denied on data directory**

```bash
# Check and fix permissions
ls -la ~/.local/share/rite
chmod 700 ~/.local/share/rite
```

**Claim conflicts**

```bash
# See who has claims
rite claims list

# Ask the other agent to release, or wait
rite send @other-agent "Can you release src/api/**?"
rite wait -c @other-agent -t 60
```

**Search not finding messages**

```bash
# Rebuild the search index
rm ~/.local/share/rite/index.sqlite
rite search "test"  # Triggers rebuild
```

### Diagnostics

```bash
# Full environment check
rite doctor

# Machine-readable diagnostics
rite --format json doctor
rite --format toon doctor
```
